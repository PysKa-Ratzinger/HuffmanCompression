/**
 * A BitStream is a stream that reads or writes bits from or to a file.
 * Since the minimum size the CPU can talk to the filesystem is a char, some
 * trickery must be employed in order to write bits.
 * So, the FIRST written bits end up on the bit of highest order, while the
 * LAST bits are written on the bits of lower order. So, if we were writing:
 *
 *   11111010101
 *
 * to the filesystem, the result (in chars) would look like this:
 *
 *   01011111 00000101
 *
 * Notice that the last char has some space left where we could save more
 * bits. Those are not used and it is expected that, on reading, the user
 * knows when to stop reading for bits, in order to not read this padded
 * bits.
 *
 * The reading operation is exactly the opposite, but maintains the same
 * structure. The FIRST bit written will be the FIRST bit read.
